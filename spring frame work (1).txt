SPRING FRAME WORK???
spring is developed by Rodd John son in 2002 
it is also called frame work of frame work
u can integrate spring with hibernaet, struts, as well as JUNIT  mockito e.t.c
 

Spring is also used to dependency injection ????

What is dependency injection??
 part of the code is seperated from the program and kept in another file is called dependency injection

separted code is called "dependency"???

EG:::
suppose if u want to write a program to dispaly the name and age  and city of the person 
if u write presentation logic ,bussiness logic as well  data access logic in one file 
it is not a depenedency injection
it is called tightly coupled code

 if u write presentation logic ,bussiness logic as well  data access logic in seperate file 
it is called dependency injection
it is called loosely coupled code


ADVANTAGES OF SPRING FRAME WORK:::
 predefined templete:
         spring supports classes like JDBC templets to connect to the database
Dependency injection:::
 u can write a spring program in a such a way that part of the dependency is seperated from program and kept in another file
loose coupling
easy to test
interation with different modules
 like JPA JTA JMS JDBC MVC WEB REST e.t.c
declarative approch::
 mean u can use xml file also to write the program 
it is adeclaritive approach

if u use java approach to wrtie the program it is called PROGRAMATIC approach(Annoattions)


SPRING FRAMEWORK RUNTIME::
DATA ACCESS INTEGRATION--

MODULES OF SPRING::

TYPES CONTAIN IN SPRING::

since spring uses dependency injection
 so first business logic is executed then the spring container creates the object
that is ehay spring is also called IOC container
Inversion of control container

they are 2 types::
1-- bean factory::
     used to intilize configure instantiate and assemble the bean
 it is present in org.spring.bean.factory.*package
SYNTAX::
Resource r=new ClassPathResource(String xml)
BeanFactory b=new XmlBeanFactory(r)

METHODS::
object getbean(string s)
object getbean(class c)
instantiates thbe Bean

FEATURES::
does not supports annotations
doess not supports integration with another module
like ORM JTA JMS



2-- ApplicationContex::
     used to intilize configure instantiate and assemble the bean
 it is present in org.spring.bean.content.*package
SYNTAX::
ApplicationContext ac=new ClassApplicationContext(String xml)

METHODS::
object getbean(string s)
object getbean(class c)
instantiates thbe Bean

FEATURES::
 supports annotations
 supports integration with another module
like ORM JTA JMS

TYPES OF DEPENDENCY 
 there are 2 types of dependency injections::
1--setter injection
     in this business logic for spring is executd by setter method
2--constructor injection
 in this business logic for spring is executd by constructor method


STEPS TO WRITE A 1 SPRING PROGRAM:::
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1--CREATE A POJO CLASS USING SETTER/CONSTRUCTOR INJECTION
2--CREATE XML FILE TO ACHIVE DEPENDENCY INJECTION
FOR SETTER METHOD WE USE<proprty> tag
for constructor we use <constructor-arg> tag
3-- write a main program where spring IOC Container instantiates the bean

FOR FOLLOWING WE CAN ACHIVE DEPENDENCY INJECTION
1 PRIMITIVE TYPES
2 COLLECTIONS
3 MAPS
4 DEPENDENT OBJECTS


WRITE A PROGRAM TO CRAETE A CLASS CALLED BOOK WITH ID NAME CATEGORY PRICE 
USING DEPENDENCY INJECTION 

WRITE A FIRST PROGRAM IN SPRING???




injecting the dependent object

class address
{
 int streetno;
 String city;
 String state;
class Emp
{
int id;
String name;
String state;
}


u can achive it using ref attribute of <poperty> or <constructor-arg> tag

WRITE A PROGRAM TO INJECT FOLLOWING CALSS??
 class person
{
int id;
String name;
List<Language> lan;
}


how to inject collection??
<property name=" ">
<list>
<value>....</value>
</list>



how tpo inject map??
 <property name="">
 <map entery key=""  value=""/>
 <map entery key=""  value=""/>
 <map entery key=""  value=""/>

create a class called 
class student
{
int id;
Strinh name;
map<String, Integer> admission;

(where key is course name value is fee )
}
use setter injection


INNER BEAN
---------------------------------
when <bean> tag is written in the<proprtie > tag and <constructor-arg> tag is called inner bean.

writting the bean inside the constructor is called inner bean.
